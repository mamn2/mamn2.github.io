<p>Though there have been many advancements in creating a more equal society by the law, and eliminating systemic biases, one front that has remained fairly quiet is the question of nationality.
    Nationality is still used worldwide as a basis for judging the fitness of an individual to enter another nation. For example, if you are American, then you are entitled to enter Mexico visa-free. But if you're Vietnamese, you'll need to go to an embassy and get a visa.
    The following diagram shows countries ranked by their passport power, the number of foreign nations a country's citizens can enter without pre-booking a visa.</p>
<p>Find your country and select it. Then scroll down to see your passport power map.</p>
